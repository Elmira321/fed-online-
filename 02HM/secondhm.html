         Cats are generally fond of sitting in high places or perching. <br> A higher place may serve as a concealed site from which to hunt;<br> domestic cats strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree branch.<br>Another possible explanation is that height gives the cat a better observation point, allowing it to survey its territory.<br> A cat falling from heights of up to 3 m (9.8 ft) can right itself and land on its paws.<br>
         During a fall from a high place, a cat reflexively twists its body and rights itself to land on its feet using its acute sense of balance and flexibility.<br> This reflex is known as the cat righting reflex. A cat always rights itself in the same way during a fall,<br> if it has enough time to do so, which is the case in falls of 90 cm (3.0 ft) or more. <br>How cats are able to right themselves when falling has been investigated as the "falling cat problem".

         The cat family (Felidae) can pass down many colors and patterns to their offspring. <br> The domestic cat genes MC1R and ASIP allow color variety in their coats. The feline ASIP gene consists of three coding exons.<br>Three novel microsatellite markers linked to ASIP were isolated from a domestic cat BAC clone containing this gene to perform linkage analysis on 89 domestic cats segregated for melanism.<br> The domestic cat family demonstrated a cosegregation between the ASIP allele and coat black coloration
