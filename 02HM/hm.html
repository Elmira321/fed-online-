            The domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European wildcat.<br> It averages about 46 cm (18 in) in head-to-body length and 23–25 cm (9.1–9.8 in) in height,<br> with about 30 cm (12 in) long tails. Males are larger than females. Adult domestic cats typically<br> weigh 4–5 kg (8.8–11.0 lb).

            Cats have seven cervical vertebrae (as do most mammals); <br> 13 thoracic vertebrae (humans have 12);<br> seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have five);<br> three sacral vertebrae (as do most mammals, but humans have five);<br> and a variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail (humans have only three to five vestigial caudal vertebrae, fused into an internal coccyx).<br> The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's spinal mobility and flexibility. <br>Attached to the spine are 13 ribs, the shoulder, and the pelvis.<br> Unlike human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones which allow them to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their head.

                The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a powerful specialized jaw. <br> Within the jaw, cats have teeth adapted for killing prey and tearing meat.<br> When it overpowers its prey, a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long canine teeth, inserting them between two of the prey's vertebrae<br> and severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible paralysis and death.<br> Compared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth relative to the size of their jaw, which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents, which have small vertebrae

                    Cats have protractible and retractable claws. <br> In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads. This keeps the <br> claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows for the silent stalking of prey. <br> The claws on the forefeet are typically sharper than those on the hindfeet. Cats can voluntarily extend their claws <br> on one or more paws. They may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfaces.<br> Cats shed the outside layer of their claw sheaths when scratching rough surfaces. <br> Most cats have five claws on their front paws and four on their rear paws. The dewclaw is proximal to the other claws. 
                    More proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth "finger".<br> This special feature of the front paws on the inside of the wrists has no function in normal walking but is thought to be an antiskidding device used while jumping.<br> Some cat breeds are prone to having extra digits ("polydactyly"). Polydactylous cats occur along North America's northeast coast and in Great Britain.

                The cat is digitigrade. It walks on the toes, with the bones of the feet making up the lower part of the visible leg. <br> Unlike most mammals, it uses a "pacing" gait and moves both legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side.<br> It registers directly by placing each hind paw close to the track of the corresponding fore paw,<br> minimizing noise and visible tracks. This also provides sure footing for hind paws when navigating rough terrain. As it speeds up from walking to trotting,<br>its gait changes to a "diagonal" gait: The diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously.
